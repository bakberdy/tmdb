# Movies App

This project is a simple Movies App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to provide information about various movies, including search functionality, sorting options, detailed movie pages, and a personal watchlist. The app has two main pages: one for browsing movies and one for viewing a watchlist.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for movies by their titles.
- **Auto-suggest**: As users type in the search box, suggestions are displayed based on the TMDb API.
- **Sorting**: Movies can be sorted by popularity, release date, or rating.
- **Movie Details**: Users can click on a movie to see more details, such as a synopsis, rating, runtime, and main cast.
- **Watchlist**: Users can add movies to a "Watchlist" for future reference, which is stored in the browser's local storage.
